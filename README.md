# PR.4 – Functional Treat
## Description

This project is a Python program that analyzes and transforms data using functions.
It works with one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) lists.
The project helps in understanding how different types of functions are used in Python.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze and manipulate data using a menu-driven program.
Users can choose different operations to perform on the data.

## Features

* Uses built-in Python functions
* Uses user-defined functions
* Demonstrates recursion
* Uses lambda functions
* Uses *args and **kwargs
* Returns multiple values from functions
* Sorts and transforms list data
* Works with both 1D and 2D lists

## User Interface

The program uses a menu-driven interface.
Users can select different options from the menu and can exit the program anytime.

## Data Input

* Users can enter data manually
* Users can also use sample data
* Supports 1D and 2D lists
